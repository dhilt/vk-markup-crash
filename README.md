vk-markup-crash (chrome extension)
================

I dream to destroy the new VK' design, so let the struggle begin!

Here is the link to the extension on Google Webstore: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vk-markup-crush/kbanodllieoeocgfncklgjknamfpamnk.

The list of current (0.0.2) features:
- vertical margins and paddings are reduced (walls only),
- header is no more static,
- round icons are banned,
- some blocks are erased (recommended feeds, comminities)

Any help/suggestions would be appreciated. Please feel free to to make PRs.
